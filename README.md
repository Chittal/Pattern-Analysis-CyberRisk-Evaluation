# Pattern-Analysis-CyberRisk-Evaluation
This project is to detect anomalous behavior in user activity logs data using deep learning. We created a neural network model to classify anomalous or not. We used synthetic data with certain rules to classify a scenario as anomalous or non-anomalous. Then, we used logistic regression model to predict probability for each classes in testing data.
